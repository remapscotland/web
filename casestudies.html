      <h3>Violin Support - A Case Study</h3>
      &shy;

      <p>
      The musician in the photograph (shown on the right), is an accomplished violinist
      who was finding it increasingly difficult to play the instrument since a neurological
      disorder was preventing her from holding the instrument steady enough for her to be
      able to play it.
      <img class="case-study-img" src="images/violin.jpg" alt="image of the violinist playing violin"/>
      </p>
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
      REMAP Scotland Panelists were keen that the the violinist be able to continue playing
      regularly again and, they collaboratively worked alongside an experienced Saddler from
       to the local community to arrive at a solution for the musician.
      </p>
      <p>
      As soon as REMAP panelists produced a design and specification, the local Saddler was
      able to build a custom harness and saddle for the musician to use to hold the violin stready.
      </p>
      <p>
      The device went on to solve the musicians problem and made it possible for her to return to
      regular voilin practices as before so she could play again both independently, and also in 
      preparation for live music performances alongside her fellow musicians from the local fiddle
      orchestra, of which she is an active member.
