      A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.
      Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know
      when you visit a particular site.
      </p>
      <h4>How we use cookies</h4>
      <p>
      We use traffic log cookies to identify which
      pages are being used and we do this using a tool called 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">google analytics</a> which allows us
      to analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website so that the work
      we do as a charity can reach out to a wider audience.
      We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and we do NOT
      currently consent to share the information we collect using google analytics
      with other google services or any other 3rd party.
