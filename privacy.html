      A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.
      Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know
      when you visit a particular site.
      </p>
      <h4>How we use cookies</h4>
      <p>
      We use traffic log cookies to identify which
      pages are being used and we do this using a tool called 
      <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">google analytics</a> which allows us
      to analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website so that the work
      we do as a charity can reach out to a wider audience.
      We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and we do NOT
      currently consent to share the information we collect using google analytics
      with other google services or any other 3rd party.
      </p>
      <h4>Your responsibility</h4>
      <p>
      You can choose to accept or decline cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
      Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
      setting to decline cookies if you prefer, this may prevent you from accessing certain features
      on our website but we will do our best to implement features in a way which
      respects the privacy of our visitors and website users where possible.
      </p>
      <h4>Links to other websites</h4>
      <p>
      Our website may contain links to other websites of interest.
      However, once you have used these links to leave our site,
      you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.
      Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any
      information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites
      are not governed by this cookie policy.
