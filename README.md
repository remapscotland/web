REMAP Scotland are a charity who make technical aids for people with disabilities where no commercial solution currently 
exists.

### Goals of the Project

Ultimately we want to be able to take on the cases of anyone who might need our help and get the work done as quickly as possible.
To do this the developers of the site aim to implement an attractive looking, accessible website the following reasons:

 * To publicise REMAP Scotland

 * To draw in more volunteers

 * To allow members of the public and/or their friends/relatives who meet the criteria, to be able request help

 * To provide a secure way for Panel members to share and request resources and skills

 * A searchable database to allow our engineers (and where confidentiality is no issue, the public) to be able to view designs for solutions
that we design for our users

 * To encourage the public to fundraise for us

 * To encourage the public to make donations

 * To proved a convenient secure way for the public to make donations

 * To publish helpful information which may help those with disabilities from all over the world benefit from our efforts
