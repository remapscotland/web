        <h3>REMAP Scotland relies entirely on volunteers</h3>

            At present we have14 area panels covering most of Scotland
            (see the <a href="panelmap.html"> Panel Members Map </a> for details of locations).</p>

            <p>All panels welcome additional members who can help with projects and provide administrative, marketing or development support.</p>
