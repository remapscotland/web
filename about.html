      <h3>About REMAP Scotland</h3>

      <p>
      We are a Scottish charity offering a dedicated service to most of Scotland through our 14 
      area panels.
      </p>
      <p>
      Closely associated with our sister charity <a href="http://www.remap.org.uk" > REMAP</a>, which covers England,
      Northern Ireland and Wales, we share a common aim and objective: to design, manufacture and supply individual
      equipment and adaptation solutions for disabled people where no commercial solutions currently exist.
      </p>
      <p>
      Panel members usually consist of engineers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other professionals who 
      voluntarily give their time and experience.We rely wholly upon donations of materials and funds from charitable
      institutions, local services, businesses and the general public.
